# Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

## Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

`aws s3 ls`

2021-08-25 21:44:23 jz-netology-bucket-02

`terraform state list`

aws_s3_bucket.jz-bucket

`terraform state show aws_s3_bucket.jz-bucket`

```terraform

}
```

## Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы.

```terraform
terraform workspace list

  default
* prod
  stage
```

```terraform
terraform plan

Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
