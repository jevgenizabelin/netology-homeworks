# Домашнее задание к занятию "7.2. Облачные провайдеры и синтаксис Терраформ."

## Задача 1. Регистрация в aws и знакомство с основами (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

- `aws configure list`

```json

    region                us-west-2      config-file    ~/.aws/config

```

`terraform plan`

```terraform
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
